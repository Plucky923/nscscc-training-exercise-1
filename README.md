# NSCSCC Training Exercise 1

This is the first training exercise for the NSCSCC, based on Scala programming language.

Build guide and usage instructions are available [here](./GUIDE.md).

## Contributions to Exercises

Contributions are welcome! Please fork this repository and create a pull request with your changes.

The exercises are located in the `src/main/scala` directory. Each exercise is a separate package containing the solution.

The test suite is located in the `src/test/scala` directory. It contains unit tests for each exercise.

For example, `src/main/scala/ex1` contains the solution to the first exercise, whose test suite is located in `src/test/scala`. You can contribute your own exercises as long as their respective test suite and add them to the repository. The number of exercises will be 50 with the help of your contributions.

## Cautions

1. Do not add miscellaneous files or directories that are generated by the build tools or IDEs to the repository. These excluded files should be added to the `.gitignore` file.
2. Do not make large changes to the code without discussing it with the rest of the team. This will help to avoid conflicts and errors.
3. Do make changes only to the exercises and test suite if there is no essential reason. Do not modify other people's code without their consent.
